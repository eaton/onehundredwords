It wasn't hunting, really. Not at all like giving chase.

Running full tilt, slicing between frightened pedestrians and food carts and into the street and sliding over the hood of the yellow cab and hitting pavement without breaking stride. The rest of the team just fell back and let me bring the runner down; they couldn't keep up. Couldn't see what I saw, couldn't feel what I did.

I knew every turn, every dodge, every move a second before he did -- as long as I held that coin of his. I wasn't chasing, just going where I knew I should.
