They're called redlines because that's how they show up in webmail: a big red line that separates "donuts in the office kitchen" notes from the serious stuff.

"Fwd: NAGIOS ALERT: Gold Customer death immanent," for example. That's a redline.

Forty minutes old, with a chain of CC's and forwards that's already ten deep. We've already notified him -- 5 minute turnaround, right in the contract, the second one of our sympathetics gets mortality signals -- but this one's thorny. The watcher saw something else, and no one's quite sure what it *was*.

Well, fantastic.

Looks like overtime for the support desk tonight.
